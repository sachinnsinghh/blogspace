Welcome to BlogSpace! This project is a full-stack web application built with React in the frontend and Cloudflare Workers in the backend, using a variety of technologies and tools to provide a secure and efficient user experience.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and development experience.
Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, offering type inference for frontend data validation.
Backend:
Cloudflare Workers: A serverless platform for deploying applications directly onto Cloudflare's global cloud network.
TypeScript: Used for server-side scripting in Cloudflare Workers, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
Prisma: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and management.
PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system, used with Prisma for data storage and retrieval.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims securely between two parties, commonly used for authentication.
Features
Authentication:
Utilizes JWT for secure authentication and authorization of users.
Data Validation:
Implements Zod for frontend data validation, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
Database Management:
Prisma ORM with connection pooling for efficient database interactions with PostgreSQL.
